#Past week
    - Install MPI, DIY, PyDIY
    - Read up on Hough transform
    - Discovered scikit-image implementation of _hough_ellipse does not use Hough transform paradigm.
#Next week
    - Implement Hough line transform in PyDIY
    - Research ways to potentially improve _hough_ellipse in scikit-image
#Issues
    - PyDIY currently does not support Python 3.5
